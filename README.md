# GlideLogicX

**Context-aware descent and approach advisory plugin for X-Plane 12**

GlideLogicX is a modular, aircraft-adaptive plugin designed to simulate intelligent descent guidance and procedural callouts within X-Plane 12. It calculates optimal descent profiles based on current flight parameters, aircraft model data, and navigational distance, providing in-sim advisory for realistic approach execution.

## Features

- Dynamic Top of Descent (TOD) calculation based on groundspeed, altitude, and destination distance
- Descent rate and vertical speed advisories
- Procedural prompts for approach phase (e.g. landing lights, altimeter setting, checklist flows)
- Context-aware callouts based on altitude thresholds and phase of flight
- Preliminary ILS guidance support (glideslope capture alerts, localizer intercept status)
- Configurable aircraft profiles for tailored descent behavior per model

## COMING SOON SUMMER 2025
